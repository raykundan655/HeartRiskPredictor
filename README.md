# Heart Disease Prediction Web App

A machine learning-powered web application to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on user health indicators. This project combines a logistic regression model, a Flask backend, and an AI-generated frontend to deliver real-time predictions.

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how machine learning models can be deployed in real-time applications and made accessible through simple web interfaces.

## Dataset

- *Source:* [Kaggle - Heart Failure Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)
- *Features Used:*
  - Age
  - Sex
  - Chest Pain Type
  - RestingBP
  - Cholesterol
  - Fasting Blood Sugar
  - Resting ECG
  - MaxHR
  - Exercise-Induced Angina
  - ST Depression (Oldpeak)
  - ST Slope
  - HeartDisease: output class [1: heart disease, 0: Normal]


---


##  Machine Learning Model

- *Model Used:* Logistic Regression
- *Preprocessing:* Label Encoding for categorical features (Sex, ChestPainType, RestingECG, ExerciseAngina, ST_Slope)
- *Performance:* ~84% accuracy on test data
- *Encoders and model* saved as .pkl files for use in the web application.


---


## Web Application

- *Backend:* Flask (Python)
- *Frontend:* AI-generated HTML (served using Jinja2 via Flask)
- *API Endpoint:* POST /api/predict  
  Accepts JSON input and returns prediction with a message.

## Project Workflow: How to Run Locally

1. *Clone the Repository*  
   Start by cloning the GitHub repository to your local machine. Open a terminal and run:


2. *Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)*  
Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
- On Windows:
  
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate
  
- On macOS/Linux:
  
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  


3. *Install Required Dependencies*  
Install all the necessary packages using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt


4. *Train the Model (if not already trained)*  
If the model and encoder .pkl files do not exist, generate them by running:
heart.py

This will train the model using the dataset and save all required files into the Heart Disease/ folder.


5. *Run the Flask Web App*  
Start the Flask development server by running:
app.py

After running this command, the app will be available at:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/


6. *Use the Web Interface*  
Open a browser and navigate to the above URL. You’ll see a form where you can input details and get a prediction.


7. *Use the API (Optional)*  
You can also make a POST request to /api/predict with JSON data using Postman or any HTTP client.
